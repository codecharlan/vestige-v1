# 🗿 Vestige - Temporal Code Intelligence
> *Uncover the traces of your codebase through time. Certified Master Release.*

Vestige brings **temporal awareness** directly into your code editor. See which code is ancient, which is churning, and which just changed—all without leaving your file.

Vestige 2.0 (**Centurion Vision**) introduces a world-class temporal intelligence engine and **Zenith Elite** aesthetics. Experience a premium, innovative engineering platform that reveals code age, churn, and evolution through the lens of AI.

## 🏛️ Core Features (The Foundation)
*Essential temporal utility for every developer.*

### 🗺️ Heatmap Explorer
Files in the Explorer are automatically color-coded based on their git history:
- 🔥 **High Churn** - Files that change frequently (Red indicator)
- 🗿 **Fossils** - Ancient, untouched code (Grey indicator)
- ✨ **Recent** - Fresh changes (Green indicator)

### ✍️ Inline Temporal Annotations
Tactile editor decorations that reveal history as you code:
- **Visual Cues**: Instantly see if a block of code is a "fossil" or "active churn".
- **Dynamic Updates**: Decorations update automatically as you commit and edit.

### 🕰️ Time Travel (Timeline Panel)
View the complete commit history of your file in a beautiful, lazy-loaded timeline:
- Chronological commit list with full author metadata.
- **👁️ View File at Commit**: Click to see exactly what the file looked like at any point in history.
- **Trend Analysis**: Statistical view of commit frequency over years/months.

### 🔍 Smart Refactoring & Coupling
Discover hidden architectural patterns:
- **Coupled Files**: Identify files that frequently change together with your current file.
- **Dependency Insights**: Uncover hidden connections between distant modules (e.g., "🔗 Coupled with: `utils.js` (80% correlation)").

### 🛡️ Rich Status Bar & Hover
- **Status Bar Metrics**: Live Stability Score (0-100%) and Top Contributor ownership.
- **Deep Hover**: Hover over any line to see last change date, author, commit hash, and file-level churn statistics.
