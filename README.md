# 🗿 Vestige - Temporal Code Intelligence
> *Uncover the traces of your codebase through time. Certified Master Release.*

Vestige brings **temporal awareness** directly into your code editor. See which code is ancient, which is churning, and which just changed—all without leaving your file.

Vestige 2.0 (**Centurion Vision**) introduces a world-class temporal intelligence engine and **Zenith Elite** aesthetics. Experience a premium, innovative engineering platform that reveals code age, churn, and evolution through the lens of AI.

## 🏛️ Core Features (The Foundation)
*Essential temporal utility for every developer.*

### 🗺️ Heatmap Explorer
Files in the Explorer are automatically color-coded based on their git history:
- 🔥 **High Churn** - Files that change frequently (Red indicator)
- 🗿 **Fossils** - Ancient, untouched code (Grey indicator)
- ✨ **Recent** - Fresh changes (Green indicator)

### ✍️ Inline Temporal Annotations
Tactile editor decorations that reveal history as you code:
- **Visual Cues**: Instantly see if a block of code is a "fossil" or "active churn".
- **Dynamic Updates**: Decorations update automatically as you commit and edit.

### 🕰️ Time Travel (Timeline Panel)
View the complete commit history of your file in a beautiful, lazy-loaded timeline:
- Chronological commit list with full author metadata.
- **👁️ View File at Commit**: Click to see exactly what the file looked like at any point in history.
- **Trend Analysis**: Statistical view of commit frequency over years/months.

### 🔍 Smart Refactoring & Coupling
Discover hidden architectural patterns:
- **Coupled Files**: Identify files that frequently change together with your current file.
- **Dependency Insights**: Uncover hidden connections between distant modules (e.g., "🔗 Coupled with: `utils.js` (80% correlation)").

### 🛡️ Rich Status Bar & Hover
- **Status Bar Metrics**: Live Stability Score (0-100%) and Top Contributor ownership.
- **Deep Hover**: Hover over any line to see last change date, author, commit hash, and file-level churn statistics.

---

## 🌌 Zenith Elite Aesthetics (New!)
*The Holographic Frontier of Engineering Tools.*

- **Organic Depth**: Micro-noise textures and radial mesh gradients for a tactile feel.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Variable font weight shifts that react to editor hover.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Premium backdrop blur with luminous, reactive borders.
- **Liquid Status Bars**: Fluid-dynamic animations for stability and health indicators.
- **Bioluminescent UI**: Pulsing organic light indicators for technical debt.

---

## 🧠 Centurion Intelligence (AI) (New!)
*Powered by Historical Intent.*

- **AI Code Archaeologist**: Hypothesizes why legacy code persists (Load-Bearing Wall, Sunken Treasure, or Zombie).
- **Historical Persona**: Understand the "soul" of the original author through AI-synthesized intent.
- **Ghost Chat**: Pair program with the "Ghost" of a developer using their historical intent.
- **Predictive ROI**: AI-driven stability impact analysis for proposed refactorings.
- **Automatic Summaries**: Single-sentence technical summaries for complex historical diffs.

---

## 📊 Immersive Visualizations
- **Gravity Well (3D)**: A physics-based simulation of file complexity and "gravitational" debt.
- **Sankey Flow**: Visualize the movement of code between modules over time.
- **Blast Radius Analyzer**: Calculate the "impact tremor" of a file's complexity.
- **Sunburst Ownership**: Hierarchical treemap revealing the "Kings" of the codebase.
- **Archaeology Skill Trees**: Progress through discovery to unlock advanced features.

---

## 🛡️ Enterprise Strategy
- **Handoff Assistant**: Identifies modules at risk of knowledge loss.
- **Mentorship Matcher**: Recommends historical experts for any file.
- **Debt Horizon Forecasting**: Predicts technical debt growth over 180 days.
- **CI/CD Gatekeeper**: Prevent high-risk temporal drift in main branches.
- **Enterprise Bridges**: JIRA ticket creation and Slack/Discord Lore sharing.
- **Documentation Drift**: Alerts you when docs fall out of sync with evolution.
